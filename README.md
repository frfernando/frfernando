My name is Emanuele, but everyone calls me **Manu :)**
\
\
ðŸ“± I've been working as QA Engineer for the last 4 years and currently I'm working with Mobile Automation with Appium and TS\
ðŸ“š The last year I developed at least 10 projects (web and API) with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)\
ðŸ”® I already worked and I really like [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/) language\
ðŸŽ¨ I really like the design area too\
ðŸŒµ In my free time I take care of my plants and watch series


#### Do you need some help with QA and Automation?
